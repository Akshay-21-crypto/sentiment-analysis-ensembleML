Everything is average or below average. The menu isn't creative and everything is just a collection of typical popular fares from different cuisines and restaurants. The problem is, they are just OK. There isn't a sense of signature dish or a reason to go back especially since the place is somewhat our of the way. - (Slightly Negative)

Room was not up to Marriott Standards, smears of wine/blood on the wall next to the bed. Doors are all banged up with mismatched paint. Room furniture damaged & dirty, this is basically a Motel 6 version. Unable to get coffee in the lobby until 7:00 am, coffee in the room is terrible & only decaf. Marketplace cafe only had water, Mountain Dew & tea. No selection, probably last stocked before the pandemic. They were knocking on our door at 10:00 am to ask when we were checking out. Would definitely advise anyone DO NOT STAY HERE.

We stayed here for a last minutes, quick family vacation. I would say the accommodations were "ok". I mean it's just a place to sleep between the beach and other activities. I would have said the room was generally clean except my wife showed me an unbelievable amount of trash directly behind the bed. I will admit our stay got off to a bad start. When I got to the front desk around 9:30p after an 8 hour drive, I was surprised to find no one at the front desk. I waited a good five minutes and finally thought I would try the hotel number...no answer. I waited another couple of minutes....called, no answer.... waited another couple of minutes, called, finally someone answers and I hear a female voice from the other side of the wall behind me say hello...not a good start to our stay.... If you stay here, try to get a room on the first floor, unless you want to spend you vacation waiting on the elevator. The waits on the elevator are long. Both guest and staff express their frustration and fear of getting stuck on the elevator. The breakfast is ok, but you have to fight large crowds for average to below average food. In a nutshell, there are better places to stay in Galveston.  - (Negative)

Quality Inn and suites is a beautiful relaxing atmosphere. The fifth floor is where you get the most magnificent view of the water. Coming here from Houston is the ideal getaway for my husband and myself. The staff here does a wonderful job of trying to accommodate myself and husband who are a disabled couple. We absolutely love coming here - (Positive)

Good food. Very expensive. Food is overpriced. You're really paying for the service. Service was spectacular, though I don't expect to eat there again. - (Slightly Positive)

We had been on a fishing charter the morning and decided to grab lunch. This place had such a great review we decide to try it. It started off poorly. The restaurant has a fairly nice place and my husband had a ball cap on. He was asked to remove it. I understand that but they were a little rude about it.

The food was really the issue. My husband ordered fish tacos and I ordered a seafood tostada. The seafood tostada was basically a large seafood salad with a ton of vinaigrette on it. The fish tacos had very little flavor.

We were not impressed, and probably will not be back to this restaurant.

A total no no. The curry was just oily gravy and the naan was more of burnt bread than anything else. Biryani was full of masala and tasted more uncooked than anything else. Service is very very slow. - (Negative)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can't expect a good ambience here but it's not that bad it's okay. As this is my uncle's restaurant I get pretty good briyani. Briyani is good here. You get really nice veg briyani here. This place is pretty good. - (Slightly Positive)

I would never recommend any person to go for turkish central as I've faced problem with takeaway for more than 3 times ...one or two times can be understood but not more than that please friends do not go for turkish central thanks - (Slightly Negative)

Really unhygienic. Found a strand of hair in the shawarma.

'Check your order before leaving because 9 out of 10, you will be lacking something if youre taking it back to your office. The packers are very careless.  Either they forget the lettuce or tomatoes even though its standard. On a good day, youll be lucky enough not to get a mini piece of wilted lettuce and a tomatoe the size of a half of dollar. If only there were other locations in the area, I would rather go for my lunch. - (Slightly Negative)
----------------------------------------------------------

'How do you mess up an order of nuggets when the order is "five orders of spicy nuggets"...Lesson learned. Never again will I order from here. Now Im hungry and out $10. Because you didnt know how to count up to five. All I wanted was nuggets. You took that from me Wendys. You took my joy and my money. - (Slightly Negative)
-------------------------------------------------------------------

'When it comes to fast food, my fave place is Wendys. This particular location is the one I would frequent when I worked around here. Yeah, it was always crowded at lunch time but there were more than enough people working there, the line would move pretty fast. I would almost always get something off the Value Menu, since Im cheap like that. But, pinky swear, you can buy enough stuff off the cheap menu to fill you up for less than five bucks. And since this is in the Financial District, you had a TV at each end of the dining room, plastered on either CNN or Fox News or even Bloomberg. And nope, people would get offended when I asked if i could watch my "stories" while I ate. Guess these people arent fans of Days of Our Lives.The cool thing is that this place is open on weekends, so whenever I worked on a Saturday I knew I could come here. Good times! - (Slightly Positive)
